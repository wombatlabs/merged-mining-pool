Features
--------
  - Stratum Networking.  Tested for 1000+ concurrent clients.
  - ZMQ subscriptions for real-time communication with the blockchain  
  - Unique extranonce generation for a parallel client workload
  - Merged mining for resource efficiency
  - API service for a front-end website
  - RPC failover for high availability
  - Multiple payout schemes for client rewards
  - Single coin mining for testing

Todo
----
  - Variable difficulty

Getting Started
---------------

Open config.example.json to get started.

You'll need access to a [blockchain RPC](https://dogecoin.com/dogepedia/how-tos/operating-a-node/) and a [ZMQ block notification URL](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/zmq.md).

For ZMQ notifications you have to start your nodes with block notification on:

    // Assuming your node is on the same machine as this pool
    -zmqpubhashblock="tcp://127.0.0.1:<your-port-here>"

    //Remote nodes need additional configuration if they're on WAN or LAN (firewalls, port forwarding, etc.)
    -zmqpubhashblock="tcp://0.0.0.0:<your-port-here>"

Setting up the Postgres database
--------------------------------

The pools have been tested with Postgres 16.  Once installed, you can log into the Postgres server w/

    sudo -u postgres psql # Unix
    psql -U postgres # Windows

Open the directory below to find scripts that will set up your databases.

    persistence/schemas

You can skip 3-multi-pool-partition.sql if you're still testing.

Building the Pool
-----------------
```
go build
```

Then once building is complete, you can run the pool like so:
```
./dogepool
```

To run the pool behind screen, can run this:
```
screen -dmS pool ./dogepool
```

Connecting to the pool
----------------------

Once you have it running, your client can connect with the following login:

  - username: yourPrimaryCoinMinerAddress-yourAux1CoinMinerAddress.rigID
  - password: none

Contributing
------------

I hope to have created a system in which multiple chains can be supported from one project.  As such, most coins can be merged mined from this same project.

Centered around type Generator interface{} (and a future type RPC interface{}) any coin, in any coin family, can be supported as a go module or a microservice.

Feel free to contact me via [Github Discussions](https://github.com/dreams-money/merged-mining-pool/discussions) to discuss how you can implement your chain.

New features may be discussed, but are generally based around Stratum and chain updates.
